## Description
<p align="justify">
In the work we have implemented an ensemble of Naive
Bayes classifiers using committee of bootstraps and monte carlo splits.
We have conducted 50 iterations of learning in each tested model. Fixed
percentage of random objects from the original training system was used.
New training decision systems that were considered consisted of 10 to
100 percent of random objects from original training decision system.
Two main variants were checked, first with objects returning after the
drawn (bootstraps) - and without returning (as monte carlo splits). We
have presented how Naive Bayes classifier works in mentioned models on
selected data from UCI repository.

## Repository
Repository contains two datasets from UCI repository (australian, diabetes) as text files, output example with results visualization and software including program to perform monte carlo splits based test and bootstrap test.


## Software

#### Input

#### Output

1. Run Bootstraps application.
